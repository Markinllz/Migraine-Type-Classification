# Migraine-Type-Classification
This project focuses on classifying different types of migraines based on a comprehensive set of symptoms and clinical observations. The dataset, sourced from an open-access publication, provides detailed symptom profiles, making it suitable for both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.



Project Overview
Data Analysis: Performed EDA to understand the distribution of symptoms and migraine types.
Preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables, handled missing values, and scaled features for model training.
Modeling: Implemented and compared several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and PR AUC to ensure robust classification results.
Visualization: Used heatmaps, pairplots, and other visual tools to analyze feature relationships and model outcomes.
